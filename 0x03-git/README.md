## Learning Objectives :bulb:
* What is source code management
* What is Git
* What is GitHub
* What is the difference between Git and GitHub
* How to create a repository
* What is a README
* How to write good READMEs
* How to commit
* How to write helpful commit messages
* How to push code
* How to pull updates
* How to create a branch
* How to merge branches
* How to work as collaborators on a project
* Which files should and which files should not appear in your repo

## Requirements :white_check_mark:
* A README.md file at the root of the holbertonschool-zero_day repo, containing a description of the repository
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of this project (i.e. 0x03-git), describing what this project is about
* Do not use GitHub’s web UI, but the command line to perform the exercise (except for operations that can not possibly be done any other way than through the web UI). You won’t be able to perform many of the task requirements on the web UI, and you should start getting used to the command line for simple tasks because many complex tasks can only be done via the command line.
* Your answer files should only contain the command, and nothing else

## Tasks :page_with_curl:
### Mandatory
- [x] **[0. Repo-session](./)** - Create a new directory called 0x03-git in your holbertonschool-zero_day repo. Make sure you include a README.md in your directory.
- [x] **[1. Coding fury road](./bash/holberton)** - For the moment we have an empty project directory containing only a README.md. It’s time to code!
- [x] **[2. Collaboration is the base of a company](./bash/holberton)** - For this project, create a branch update_script
- [x] **[3. Collaboration: be up to date](./README.md)** - For this task – and only for this task – please update your file README.md in the master branch from Github.com. It’s the only time you are allowed to update and commit from Github interface.
### Advance :muscle:
- [x] **[4. HAAA what did you do???](./0x03-git)** - Merge the branch update_script to master: “Cool, all my changes will be now part of the main branch, ready to be deployed!”
- [x] **[5. Never push too much](./.gitignore)** - Create a .gitignore file and define a rule to never push ~ files (generated by Emacs).
